smoothScroll
============

A teeny tiny smooth scroll script with ease-in-out effect and no jQuery.

smoothscroll.js
-
This script will search for internal links and will add a smooth scrolling effect to navigate to anchors.
Thsi works in Firefox, Chrome, Opera and Safari.

It should work on IE10, and maybe in IE9, but I do not have on here to test.
Unsupported browser would just use the normal internal link behaviour.

There is an easing function. You can change it quite easily in the code. Here is where I found the one I use:

Example
-
Th example file is the script applied to a w3c page. I just changed the style so the table of content is fixed to the left, and added the script.
Check out the result. Wouldn't that be great?


While I was looking for a name for this script, I found these sites. If this script is not what you need, you might have more luck there:
